## I. Minimum Viable Product

9-to is an Airbnb-inspired web application built using Ruby on Rails and React.js. The service helps freelancers and small startups find their ideal office space at flexible terms, without the hassle of signing a lease. By the end of Week 9, the app will satisfy the following criteria:

1. [ ] **Account Registration & Login** (including Guest/Demo Login)
2. [ ] **Seed Data.** Users, owners, listings, reservations, favorites. (For MVP -- see schema.)
3. [ ] **User Features**
  - Browse Workspaces with search/map/combination of both
  - Reserve Workspaces
  - View & Update Reservations
  - (Bonus) Save "Favorites"
  - (Bonus) Review Workspaces
  - (Bonus) Update account
  - (Bonus) Host ("Owner") Functionality â€” that is, the ability to add/manage a listing.
  - (Bonus) Messaging between owners/tenants
4. [ ] **Smooth Scrolling & Navigation**. No bugs!
5. [ ] **Hosting on Heroku**
6. [ ] **CSS/UI Style** just like Airbnb. Aim for that first, improve upon it later (if you can).
7. [ ] **Production README**, replacing this README (Reference the [sample production README](https://github.com/appacademy/sample-project-proposal/blob/master/docs/production_readme.md)
